Mentor (Victor) Reflection

Time Spent: a lot of different days and time..

I used ChatGPT as a coding assistant to help guide me through the structure, explain errors, and suggest improvements. It helped me understand canvas, JavaScript image handling, and gave step-by-step code breakdowns.

*What I Learned (Can't remember all but I'll try) :
- How to use the `<canvas>` element in HTML5.
- How to get and use the 2D rendering context with `getContext("2d")`.
- How to load an image from file input and draw it on a canvas.
- How to overlay styled text for meme creation.
- Basic debugging with the browser console.

**Challenges I Overcame:**
- An error with `ctx.clearRect` not working due to the script loading before the DOM.
- Understanding how `FileReader` works and when to trigger the drawing logic.

**Tools Used:**
- ChatGPT (AI assistant) for step-by-step guidance and error explanation.

**Next Steps: I might do this some other days once I'm done with the course
- Add a download meme feature.
- Try auto-sizing text or templates.
